## Hello fellow programmer ðŸ‘‹

I am **Prabodh Gyawali**, a second year student in the University of Leeds.

I am currently in the stage of learning and tinkering with things whilst occasionally building. 
ðŸŽ¯: Cycling through READING, BUILDING, LEARNING, ... more to one day work in cutting-edge technology.

### Philosophy: 
- I strongly believe that anyone can learn anything they want as long as they have an internet connection and it takes 10000 hours to be an expert in a field.
- Big fan of open-source software
- Understanding hardware is as important as understanding software

### Funding Rate Arbitrage:
Open-source Financial trading bot front and backend interface: [FundingRateArbitrage](https://github.com/50shadesofgwei/SynthetixFundingRateArbitrage). 
Site is live: [fundingratesniper.com](https://fundingratesniper.com)
- Bunch of projects on Github public and private repos related to what I am learning
Will spend free time during weekend ironing out bugs to improve UI/UX and backend code for the website.
